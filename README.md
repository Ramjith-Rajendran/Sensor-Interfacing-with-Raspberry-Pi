This lab focused on sensor interfacing using the <b>Raspberry Pi 5 and Sense HAT</b>. The primary goals were to control the LED matrix to display messages and retrieve real-time environmental data (temperature, humidity, and pressure) using Python. These tasks are foundational for embedded AI and robotics applications.
